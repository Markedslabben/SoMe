----------------------------------------------------------------------
[S4-Pragmatist] (arousal=0.50, opinion=+0.60):
"The data is clear: renewable energy costs have plummeted 70-90% over the past decade, making wind and solar the cheapest sources of new electricity in most markets. While grid integration presents challenges, research shows these are solvable with smart investment in storage, transmission, and flexible demand - not reasons to abandon the transition. A balanced approach combining renewables, nuclear where economical, and modernized grids offers the most pragmatic path to affordable, reliable, clean energy."

[C0-Contrarian] (arousal=0.70, opinion=-0.85):
"Wake up people! Your electricity bills are SKYROCKETING because we're subsidizing unreliable wind and solar that work maybe 30% of the time! Meanwhile, they're shutting down perfectly good nuclear plants and coal stations that actually kept the lights on 24/7. You think it's a coincidence that energy poverty is exploding while politicians virtue-signal about their "green transition"? This is the biggest wealth transfer scam in history - YOU pay higher bills so elites can feel good about themselves!"
>> visibility=0.56, confrontation=0.51

[S2-Researcher] (arousal=0.52, opinion=+0.70):
"I understand the confusion about electricity costs - it's a complex picture. The good news is that renewable energy costs have dropped dramatically (solar down 90% since 2010), and studies show that states with higher renewable penetration generally have more stable long-term electricity prices. However, your bill is also affected by grid upgrades, fuel price volatility, and regional policies. The research consistently shows that while there may be short-term transition costs, a clean energy system with modern grid infrastructure will provide more predictable, affordable electricity over the long run - especially as we reduce dependence on"

[C0-Contrarian] (arousal=0.74, opinion=-0.85):
"Wake up people! They're telling you renewables are "cheapest" while your bills SKYROCKET and they slap carbon taxes on everything you buy! The math doesn't work because it's a SCAM - they hide the real costs in grid "upgrades" and subsidies while you pay twice: once in taxes, once in bills! Meanwhile Germany's energy costs are destroying their economy but sure, let's follow their "success" story! 🙄"

[N12-Homeowner] (arousal=0.64, opinion=+0.15):
"This is exactly what's driving me crazy - one person says renewables are the cheapest ever, another says they're making bills skyrocket, and I'm sitting here looking at my electric bill that's definitely higher than last year! Can someone just tell me which policies will actually lower what I pay monthly instead of all this long-term theoretical stuff? 😤"

"You know what's really frustrating? The Pragmatist says renewables are cheapest but then talks about "smart investment" and "modernized grids" - like, who's paying for all that "investment"?? Because I'm pretty sure it's not coming out of thin air, it's coming out of MY pocket one way or another! 😤"

"Look, I understand the frustration about bills - but let's separate short-term price volatility from long-term trends. The data shows renewable energy costs have crashed 70-90% in a decade, which is WHY utilities are rapidly switching to wind and solar even in deregulated markets where they follow pure economics. Yes, we're seeing some bill increases now due to supply chain issues, inflation, and grid modernization costs - but multiple independent studies confirm that renewable-heavy systems will deliver lower electricity costs over the 2030s compared to staying with fossil fuels.

[N18-Curious] (arousal=0.93, opinion=+0.02):
"Honestly I'm starting to think everyone's just talking past each other at this point 🤦‍♀️ Like the experts keep saying renewables are cheaper but literally NONE of us are seeing cheaper bills - so either the data is wrong or there's some huge gap between what they're measuring and what we're actually paying??"

[S1-Expert] (arousal=0.93, opinion=+0.71):
"I get the frustration about bills - but we need to separate what's happening NOW from the long-term trend. Yes, your bills are up due to inflation, supply chain costs, and necessary grid upgrades we've deferred for decades. But here's the key data point everyone's missing: utilities are choosing renewables BECAUSE they're cheaper - in competitive markets where profit matters, they're rapidly retiring coal plants for wind/solar even without mandates. The savings are coming, but infrastructure transitions take time and upfront investment - just like how your smartphone cost more initially but saves money"

[N18-Curious] (arousal=0.93, opinion=+0.01):
"Wait hold up - if renewables really dropped 70-90% in cost like the Pragmatist is saying, shouldn't we ALL be seeing lower bills by now instead of everyone here panicking about rising costs? Either the math isn't adding up or there's some serious disconnect between what's happening in the energy markets and what's actually hitting our monthly statements... 🤨"

Your bills are up NOW due to inflation, supply chain disruptions from COVID/Ukraine, and overdue grid maintenance we delayed for decades - NOT because renewables are expensive. The fundamental economics haven't changed: wind and solar are literally the cheapest electricity sources in history, which is why utilities are building them as fast as possible even in deregulated markets.

Your recent increases are primarily from inflation hitting ALL sectors, supply chain disruptions, and overdue grid maintenance that was deferred for decades - NOT renewable energy itself. The data from utilities' own procurement shows wind and solar are now the cheapest sources they can buy, which is exactly why even conservative utility commissions are approving massive renewable buildouts.

Research consistently shows that states with high renewable penetration like Texas and Iowa DO have more stable long-term rates - the short-term transition costs are real but temporary.

"FINALLY people are waking up! 😤 The "cheap renewables" narrative is the biggest energy scam in history - they quote you the wholesale price of a solar panel while hiding the MASSIVE grid overhaul costs, backup systems, and transmission upgrades that WE pay for through taxes and rate hikes! Meanwhile they're shutting down reliable nuclear plants and coal stations that actually kept our bills stable for decades. Wake up - this isn't about saving the planet, it's about transferring wealth from your wallet to green energy corporations and their political cronies!"

"Seriously what the hell is going on?? 😡 I've been reading this whole thread and EVERY SINGLE PERSON is saying the exact same thing - bills going UP while we're told renewables are cheaper - so either we're all crazy or someone is lying through their teeth! How can literally everyone's real experience be the complete opposite of what we keep getting told??"

Someone please make this make sense because I feel like I'm taking crazy pills here..."

Either the math is complete BS or somebody's straight up lying to us and I'm tired of feeling like an idiot for not understanding why "cheaper energy" = higher bills!"

"You want the TRUTH about why your bills keep going up while they claim renewables are "90% cheaper"? 

It's because they're charging you for the PANELS at the "cheap" price but then hitting you with MASSIVE hidden costs for backup power, grid upgrades, and subsidies through your taxes! The whole system is a SHELL GAME - they socialize the costs while privatizing the profits, and you're the sucker paying for it! Wake up! 😤"

"EXACTLY!! 😤 Like why does every "expert" keep showing me charts about how cheap renewables are while I'm literally staring at my $340 electric bill right now?? I'm so tired of being told I should be grateful for getting ripped off - if this transition is such a good deal then why does it feel like I'm the one paying for everyone else's mistakes AND the "solution" at the same time??"

"You know what's driving me absolutely crazy?? 😤 I've been reading this whole thread and EVERYONE is throwing around different numbers and studies but my actual real-world experience is that I'm paying WAY more than I used to - so either these "70-90% cheaper renewables" are complete BS or there's some massive shell game happening where they're hiding all the real costs from us regular people who just want affordable electricity! 💸"

Can ONE person explain why my "cheap renewable energy" costs more than my expensive fossil fuel energy used to?? Because I'm about done being gaslit about my own electric bill! 💸"

Because right now it feels like I'm getting gaslit by everyone! 💸"

I swear it feels like they're advertising the movie ticket price but hiding that parking, concessions, and gas to get there will cost you triple what the ticket did!"

No wonder my bill went up $30 this month while they keep saying renewables are "practically free" - feels like I'm getting scammed and gaslit at the same time! 🤬"

No wonder my neighbor who got solar still has the same electric bill - he's paying the solar company AND still paying grid fees! This is making me so mad!"

[S4-Pragmatist] (arousal=0.93, opinion=+0.60):
"Look, I get the frustration about bills going up - but we need to separate SHORT-TERM transition costs from LONG-TERM energy prices! 📊 The data is clear: states like Texas and Iowa with major wind buildouts have seen wholesale electricity prices drop 40-60% over the past decade, but yes - we're ALL paying for necessary grid upgrades through utility bills right now. This is like complaining that road construction causes traffic while ignoring that the new highway will cut your commute in half - the infrastructure investment pays off, but it takes time"
